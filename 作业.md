####  **Information: Information**is any entity or form that provides the answer to a[question](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Question)of some kind or resolves[uncertainty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty). It is thus related to[data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data)and[knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge), as data represents values attributed to parameters, and knowledge signifies understanding of real things or abstract concepts.[[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information#cite_note-1)As it regards data, the information's existence is not necessarily coupled to an observer (it exists beyond an[event horizon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_horizon), for example), while in the case of knowledge, the information requires a cognitive observer.

####  Positional natation:**Positional notation** or **place-value notation** is a method of representing or encoding [numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number). Positional notation is distinguished from other notations (such as [Roman numerals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals)) for its use of the same symbol for the different [orders of magnitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude) (for example, the "ones place", "tens place", "hundreds place"). This greatly simplified [arithmetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic), leading to the rapid spread of the notation across the world.

####  Algorithm:In [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics) and [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science), an **algorithm** is an unambiguous specification of how to solve a class of problems. Algorithms can perform [calculation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculation), [data processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_processing)and [automated reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_reasoning) tasks.

####  Software bug:A **software bug** is an error, flaw, [failure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Failure) or [fault](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fault_(technology)) in a [computer program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_program) or [system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_system) that causes it to produce an incorrect or unexpected result, or to behave in unintended ways.
