####  1、According to the von Neumann architecture, List basic parts of a
####  computer.

冯·诺依曼计算机主要由运算器、控制器、存储器和输入输出设备组成，它的的特点是：程序以二进制代码的形式存放在存储器中；所有的指令都是由操作码和地址码组成；指令在其存储过程中按照执行的顺序进行存储；以运算器和控制器作为计算机结构的中心等。

####  2、A computer has 64 MB (megabytes) of memory. How many bits are
####  needed to address any single byte in memory?

26

####  3、List basic parts of a CPU, include cache or not?

不包括缓存

####  (4)What mean secondary storage. List some on your PC.

二级存储（secondary storage，auxiliary storage）是计算机主存储器或内存之外的所有可访问数据存储器。外部存储以及辅助存储是其同义词。

###  (5)解释概念

####  CPU：

A central processing unit (CPU) is the electronic circuitry within a computer that carries out the instructions of a computer program by performing the basic arithmetic, logical, control and input/output (I/O) operations specified by the instructions. The computer industry has used the term "central processing unit" at least since the early 1960s. Traditionally, the term "CPU" refers to a processor, more specifically to its processing unit and control unit (CU), distinguishing these core elements of a computer from external components such as main memory and I/O circuitry.

####  RAM: 

Random-access memory  is a form of computer data storage that stores data and machine code currently being used. A random-access memory device allows data items to be read or written in almost the same amount of time irrespective of the physical location of data inside the memory. 

####  ROM:  

Read-only memory (ROM) is a type of non-volatile memory used in computers and other electronic devices. Data stored in ROM can only be modified slowly, with difficulty, or not at all, so it is mainly used to store firmware (software that is closely tied to specific hardware, and unlikely to need frequent updates) or application software in plug-in cartridges.

####  Bus:

In computer architecture, a bus (a contraction of the Latin omnibus) is a communication system that transfers data between components inside a computer, or between computers. This expression covers all related hardware components (wire, optical fiber, etc.) and software, including communication protocols.

####  Parallel Computing:

Parallel computing is a type of computation in which many calculations or the execution of processes are carried out simultaneously.

###  （6)云计算

云计算是一种按使用量付费的模式，这种模式提供可用的、便捷的、按需的网络访问， 进入可配置的计算资源共享池（资源包括网络，服务器，存储，应用软件，服务），这些资源能够被快速提供，只需投入很少的管理工作，或与服务供应商进行很少的交互。
